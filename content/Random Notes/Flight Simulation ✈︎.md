I started my journey in  #flight-simulation in 2017 with [**Flight Gear**](https://www.flightgear.org/) before switching to [**Microsoft Flight Simulator**](https://www.flightsimulator.com/), which is known for its detailed graphics and global coverage. Over time, I learned many skills and even taught others how to fly. 

Each sim session feels like an exciting challenge, where I'm pushed to explore new **destinations & scenarios**, which could be anything from weather to a fault with the aircraft, keeping my passion for aviation alive.
