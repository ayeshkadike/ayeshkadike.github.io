# Hi there, I'm Ayesh ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 19 year old Computer Engineering student @ the University of Waterloo, with a passion for building innovative & creative solutions, interested in AI & ML.
        
#### Currently

I'm exploring **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Blockchain**, focusing on neural networks, natural language processing, and large language models. Currently, I'm learning **TensorFlow** and **YOLO**, exploring their applications in image recognition, object detection, and predictive analytics. Additionally, I'm exploring how **Blockchain** can revolutionize industries by enhancing security, decentralization, and efficiency.

#### In The Past

I've worked @ **Searidge Technologies**, where I developed an **AI Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** tool to streamline consumer-business  **requirements management** and **proposal generation**. This tool enhanced efficiency by improving information retrieval and automating content generation, significantly reducing manual effort.

#### Beyond Code

Outside the world of software, some of my non-code interests include **video editing**, **photography**, and [**Flight Simulation**](Random-Notes/Flight-Simulation-âœˆ%EF%B8%8E).


#### Let's Connect

Feel free to explore my projects or reach out for collaborations!
