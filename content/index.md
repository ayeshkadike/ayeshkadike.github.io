I'm a 19 year old Computer Engineering student @ the University of Waterloo, with a passion for building innovative solutions that blend creativity and functionality interested in AI, ML and solving petty real world problems. My journey has been fueled by curiosity and a relentless drive to learn, solve problems, and create meaningful impact.

#### What I Do

- **Software Development**: I enjoy creating tools and systems that make life simpler and more efficient.
    
- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**: Exploring the possibilities of AI and ML to solve real-world challenges excites me the most.
    
- **Problem Solver**: I thrive on tackling complex challenges and finding innovative solutions.
    

#### Current Focus

Iâ€™m deeply involved in advancing my knowledge in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**, including experimenting with neural networks, natural language processing, and large language models. Iâ€™m currently learning libraries and frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **YOLO**, exploring their applications in image recognition, object detection, and predictive analytics. Iâ€™m also exploring the integration of AI systems into real-world applications to drive efficiency and innovation.

#### Beyond Code

Outside the world of software, some of my #non-code-interests include **video editing**, **photography**, and **flight simulation**. These hobbies allow me to express creativity and explore different perspectives.
